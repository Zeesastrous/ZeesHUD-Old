# ZeesHUD Legacy Version
The (in)famous TF2 HUD that looks like Persona 5's UI.
Originally made in late 2020 as a quarantine project and a 1k subscribers special to my channel.

This specific version of ZeesHUD is the version that was publicly available as of August 15, 2023. I've made it its own separate repo, as future versions of ZeesHUD will feature a drastically different layout and deprecates a significant amount of addons.
